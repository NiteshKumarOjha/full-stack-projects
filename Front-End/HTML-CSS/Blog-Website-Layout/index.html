        <h3>Internet: The Foundation of the Web</h3>

        <p><strong>What is the Internet?</strong></p>

        <p>
          The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and
          devices that enables the exchange of information and communication. It
          provides a vast array of services, including email, web browsing, file
          sharing, and more.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How Data Travels: Unraveling Data Transmission</strong></p>

        <p>
          Data travels across the internet in a fascinating way. Picture it as a
          journey of small packages called packets. These packets contain
          fragments of the data, along with special labels indicating the
          sender's and receiver's addresses. As the packets embark on their
          voyage, they don't follow a single predetermined path. Instead, they
          navigate through a network of interconnected routers. These routers
          act as guides, examining the labels on the packets and directing them
          along the most efficient paths available at that moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are received by the
          recipient's device. Here, a careful process of reassembly takes place.
          The device examines the addressing information on each packet and
          carefully arranges them in the correct order. As the packets are
          reassembled, the original data is reconstructed, allowing the intended
          recipient to access and utilize the information sent by the sender.
        </p>

        <p>
          This journey of data packets, with routers as the navigators, ensures
          that information can travel reliably and efficiently across the vast
          expanse of the internet. It's like a coordinated dance, where each
          packet finds its way through the network to reach its final
          destination, enabling seamless communication and information exchange
          between devices across the globe.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What is the Web?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The web, short for World Wide Web (WWW), is a system of interconnected
          web pages and resources accessed through the Internet. It is built
          upon technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and allows users
          to navigate between websites and access various types of content.
        </p>
        <strong>Components of the Web</strong>
        <ul>
          <li class="first-li">Web Browsers</li>
          <li>Web Servers</li>
          <li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li>
          <li>Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)</li>
